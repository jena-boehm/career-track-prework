**Objects**
- There are shorthands for object literals. Computed properties need to be surrounded by brackets. 

**Classes**
- There can only be one constructor method in a class. Static methods are used to create or clone objects, and require the ‘static’ keyword. Classes can inherit from other classes using the keyword ‘extends.’

**Destructuring**
-With destructuring, you can separate values/properties into distinct variables from arrays/objects.

**Rest**
- The rest parameter, [. . .restParameter] allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It can only be the last parameter in a function.  

**Spread**
- Spread allows for an array or string to be expanded in the place of arguments or other elements. It looks the same as rest syntax but expands rather than condenses elements.

**Function defaults**
- These assign default values if no value or undefined is passed. They make function parameters more flexible.
